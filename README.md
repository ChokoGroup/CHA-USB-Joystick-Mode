# CHA USB-Joystick-Mode
Use the CHA as 2 USB joysticks.
Tested with Windows, Linux, Android (tablets and TV).

### Thanks JJ_0 for the discovery!
CHOKO HACK v11.0.0 REQUIRED

1. Extract and copy the folder "Choko Hack v11 Joystick Mode" to the root of USB pendrive.
2. Insert the pendrive in CHA USB EXT and power on.
3. If you had more options, select "Choko Hack v11 Joystick Mode" in the Choko Menu.
4. Select if you want to use [P2 Insert] or [P2 Start] to enable USB Joystick Mode (pressing [P1 A] or [P1 B] in this installer menu).

If there wasn't Lakka or any games lists installed, now you'll see a menu at startup.
The startup menu has one (new) option to change into USB Joystick Mode.

When USB Joystick mode is selected, the CHA immediately reboots and will always boot in Joystick Mode until you press [P2 Insert] or [P2 Start] (the one you selected to install) in the first 5 seconds after the button red light turns on.

We can power up the CHA using only an USB-A to USB-A cable from the CHA USB port to your PC or we can power up the CHA as usual and then connect the USB-A to USB-A cable from CHA to PC.


### Buttons Configuration
The CHA is detected as one drvice with two independent "game pads", each with one joystick and 8 buttons.
Unfortunately, the detected layout is not the best:

             R1 L1

   ( J )   A  B  C
           X  Y  Z


With front-ends where we can define each button function, like RetroArch, MAME or Steam, this is not a big problem.
With games that run outside an emulator, each game has its way to handle the buttons. Many are playable with the CHA, many don't.


### Notes
- In RetroArch, the first time you use the CHA as joysticks you must setup remap D-PAD UP, DOWN, LEFT and RIGHT, as well as all the buttons, SELECT and START in particular.
- In Steam, some games (like Tekken) require that you define a button to make the joystick to be mapped as d-pad in order to navigate the menus.
